        <h1> Level 4: Silent Murmurs</h1>
        <p>In a world drowning in noise, only the patient ear catches the whisper. </p>

        <p>Beyond the visible, between the obvious, lies a truth scribbled in silence. Those who merely glance shall walk away blind.
        Only those who linger between the breaths of code shall glimpse the hidden relic.</p>

        <p>Every great secret wears the mask of simplicity... but do not be fooled. Not every treasure is buried deep â€” some hide in plain sight, shrouded only by our own distractions. </p>

            <input type="text" name="flag" placeholder="Whisper the forgotten code..." required>
            <br><br>
            <button type="submit">Unlock</button>
        </form>

        <!-- Within the folds of silence, echoes remain... -->
        <!-- Legends spoke of a flag once hidden here... -->
        <!-- Look deeper. Ignore the noise. Trust your instincts. -->
        <!-- flag{hidden_in_html} -->
        <!-- Missteps often lead to false clues. Stay steady. -->
        <!-- flag{hidden_in_comments} -->
        <!-- Perhaps what you seek is already before your eyes... -->
