        <h1>🔍 Level 7: The Hidden Echoes</h1>
        <p>In the vast <strong>network</strong> of invisible threads, there are whispers — secrets carried silently, hidden in the invisible currents of data. 🕵️‍♂️</p>

        <p>Sometimes, the greatest secrets lie not within the body of an item, but in the messages carried **outside of view**. You might think you’ve searched every corner, but the true answer is hidden in a place overlooked by many — a place where only the curious will venture.</p>

        <p>Trust not what meets the eye, but what remains beyond the surface. A shadow lurks within the confines of an HTTP header, waiting for the one who dares to seek it. 🦸‍♂️</p>

        <form method="POST">
            <input type="text" name="flag" placeholder="Decipher the hidden message..." required>
            <button type="submit">Reveal</button>
        </form>

        {% if message %}
            <div class="message">{{ message }}</div>
        {% endif %}

        <p>The flag isn’t buried deep. It waits for those who understand the language of headers. Seek what is invisible, yet integral.</p>

        <p>Some say it’s in the **response <strong>header</strong>**, a place where others fail to look. Could this be the key to your next step? Only those who think differently will succeed.</p>

        <p>The past tells its secrets in silence — find what speaks only to the patient and vigilant.</p>
